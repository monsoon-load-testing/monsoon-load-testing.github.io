Monsoon is an open-source, serverless framework for running browser-based load tests in the cloud. It allows users to easily test their single-page application in anticipation of traffic spikes or overall business growth. Monsoon can simulate loads of up to 20,000 concurrent users, and tests can be of any duration, from minutes to weeks or longer. Users can also see their load test results visualized in a near real-time dashboard.
